Facilyn sets down her tea and leans forward slightly, her eyes brightening with the kind of enthusiasm that comes from years of helping people navigate complex decisions.

Facilyn: Excellent! First we define what "whole" you're managing. It's about where you actually have decision-making power.

Facilyn: A manageable whole has three essential elements: the people who make decisions, the resources available to you, and the money you have or can generate.
