new-page: true

Facilyn: Now we describe how you must behave to ensure the support of those in your resource base - customers, clients, suppliers, extended family, and others whose support you need.

Me: I need more clarification on this approach.

Facilyn: Consider each group in your resource base separately. For clients whose loyalty you want to maintain, you might need to be honest, professional, prompt, reliable, producing quality work, environmentally responsible.

Facilyn: The key is thinking from their perspective - what would make them want to continue their relationship with you?

A maintenance robot methodically polishes the teahouse windows, pausing occasionally to admire its own reflection with what appears to be genuine satisfaction.
