title: Economic Well-Being
subtitle: What Money Really Provides
new-page: true

Facilyn: Economic well-being is essential for meeting basic human needs - food, clothing, shelter, health, and security. But here's the key insight: focus on what money provides, not money itself.

Facilyn: "Making a lot of money" is rarely as useful in a quality of life statement as naming what you gain from having money.

What aspect of economic well-being matters most to you?

@economic_security

tags: economic_aspects
on-arrival: qol_economic = "economic security"

Me: Economic security and stability.

Facilyn: Excellent. Economic security means having enough resources to weather uncertainties and plan for the future. It's about peace of mind, not just bank balances.

on-arrival: qol_economic = "comfortable surroundings"

Me: Comfortable surroundings and environment.

Facilyn: Yes, the ability to create and maintain spaces that support your well-being. This goes beyond luxury - it's about having environments that nurture and sustain you.

@basic_needs_fulfilled

on-arrival: qol_economic = "basic needs fulfilled"

Me: All basic needs consistently met.

Facilyn: Fundamental and wise. When basic needs are reliably met, you're free to focus on growth and contribution rather than survival.

@freedom_to_choose

on-arrival: qol_economic = "freedom to choose"

Me: Freedom to pursue what matters.

Facilyn: The wherewithal to do what you want to do. Economic well-being as a foundation for choice and self-determination.

@need_clarification

Me: I need more clarification on this approach.

Facilyn: Think of it this way - instead of saying "I want to be wealthy," ask yourself what wealth would give you. Security? Freedom? The ability to help others? That underlying benefit is what belongs in your quality of life statement.

tags: economic_next

Me: Let me think more about economic well-being.

Facilyn: Take your time. Remember, you're describing how you want your economic life to feel and function, not specific dollar amounts or possessions.

Facilyn: The entity as a whole must be prosperous, but so should the individuals within it. What does prosperity mean to you in practical, lived terms?
