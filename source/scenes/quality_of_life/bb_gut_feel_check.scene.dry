title: Gut Feel Check
subtitle: Values-Based Final Assessment
new-page: true

Facilyn: The gut feel check is always done last, after all other checks. It asks about your feelings, quality of life impact, and effects on others. This is where your values and intuition have the final say.

Facilyn: Having worked through all the previous checks with your example, how do you feel about this decision now?

What does your gut tell you about this decision?

Me: It feels right - I'm confident about this decision.

Facilyn: Excellent! When a decision passes the technical checks and feels right in your gut, you have strong alignment between analysis and intuition. This suggests a well-considered choice.

on-arrival: filter_gut_feel_status = "feels uncertain"

Me: I feel uncertain - something doesn't seem right.

Facilyn: Trust that feeling. Even if a decision looks good on paper, your intuition might be picking up on something the other checks missed. Take time to explore what's causing the unease.

on-arrival: filter_gut_feel_status = "feels wrong"

Me: It feels wrong - I have serious doubts.

Facilyn: A strong signal to pause and reconsider. Your gut feeling often integrates complex factors that analytical thinking might miss. What specifically troubles you about this choice?

@mixed_feelings
title: I have mixed feelings about it
tags: gut_feel_options
on-arrival: filter_gut_feel_status = "mixed feelings"

Me: I have mixed feelings about it.

Facilyn: Mixed feelings often reflect real trade-offs or competing values. Consider what aspects feel positive and what concerns you, then decide if the benefits outweigh the costs.

@need_clarification_gut

tags: gut_feel_options

Me: I'm not sure how to evaluate my gut feeling.

Facilyn: Ask yourself: Does this decision align with my deepest values? Will it enhance or diminish my quality of life? How will it affect people I care about? What would happen if everyone made similar choices?

Facilyn: Your gut feeling integrates all these considerations into an overall sense of rightness or wrongness. Trust what emerges when you sit quietly with the decision.

A meditation robot sits peacefully in the teahouse garden, its sensors dimmed as it practices the art of simply being present - demonstrating that even artificial intelligence recognizes the value of quiet reflection.

Me: I'm rejecting this decision entirely.
