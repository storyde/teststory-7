Facilyn: Remember, what matters is that this represents what's most important to you and that all decision makers see their thoughts reflected in it.

How would you like to approach creating your statement?

Facilyn: Think of your Quality of Life statement as painting a picture of how you want life to feel and function within your whole. It should capture simple phrases that represent your values, not well-worded sentences yet.

Facilyn: You'll refine this statement over time. What's important now is ensuring it reflects the collective sense of what's important and why you're doing what you're doing.
