Facilyn takes a long sip of her tea.

Facilyn: Now we come to the heart of it all - your Quality of Life statement. This describes how you want your life to be in the whole you've defined, based on what you most value.

Facilyn: Think of it as your collective sense of what's most important in your life.

Facilyn: What would you like to focus on first?

Me: I need more information about this.

Facilyn: Of course. Your Quality of Life statement should express why you're doing what you're doing, what you are about, and what you want to become. It's a reflection of what motivates and excites you.

Facilyn: We'll explore four key areas: Economic Well-Being, Relationships, Challenge and Growth, and Purpose and Contribution. Each area helps you articulate different aspects of how you want your life to be.

Outside the window, a dockside robot repeatedly polishes the same already-gleaming bollard, waiting for further instructions—or meaning, whichever comes first.
